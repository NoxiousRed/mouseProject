# mouseProject

This project was created to import video data, draw contours around movement seen on screen, and then output another file with motion detection drawn around all movement seen on screen. It also has an optional keystroke to end the video early, and only draw on when the video begins and when that keystroke is made. The main purpose of this program is to be applied against thermal imaging data of mice habitats, investigating the effect of human noise on the wildlife. While the main purpose of this code is for mice, it has potential to be used for many different areas of research.

This program uses OpenCV 4.6.0.66 for motion capture

This program is using Python 3.9.12

This program is using PythonVideoConverter 3.7 for converting files to .MP4
