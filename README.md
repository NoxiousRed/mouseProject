# mouseProject

This project was created to import video data from an AVI file, draw contours around movement seen on screen, and then output another AVI file with motion detection drawn around all movement seen on screen. It also has an optional keystroke to end the video early, and only draw on when the video begins and when that keystroke is made.

This program uses OpenCV 4.6.0.66 for motion capture

This program is using Python 3.9.12
